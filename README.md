## Running the code

For the scripts to work correctly, you need to install the *uncertainty_library* and necessary dependencies. We recommend to do that by running
```
$ pip install .
```
in a virtual environment with python 3.8.

The `scripts` folder contains python scripts to train the models and reproduce results for the MNIST, FashionMNIST and CelebA datasets.
